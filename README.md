This module adds many extras to the project_issue module. 

Project Contacts
================

It also creates a "project_contacts" class that associates some res.partner(s) to the selected project. 
Two contacts are selectable, a primary and a secondary.

Service Personnel
=================
A new Service Personnel field is added to res.users to identify if the person goes out on service calls.
